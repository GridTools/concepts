# GTScript language design guideline

The following principles are a guideline for designing the GTScript DSL. We try to follow these principles if we can. In some cases we cannot fulfill all principles and a trade-off has to be made and justified.

The principles are not magic, they mainly summarize the obvious.

Trivia: GTScript is an embedded DSL in Python, therefore language syntax is restricted to valid Python syntax.

1. **Language constructs should behave the same as their equivalent in other languages, especially as equivalent concepts
   in Python or well-known Python libraries (e.g. NumPy).**

   Motivation: The DSL should be readable by applying common sense and common programming language knowledge.

2. **Semantic differences should be reflected in syntactic differences.**

   Motivation: Spotting semantic differences is much harder than spotting syntactic differences.

3. **Regular use-cases should be simple, special cases can be complex.**

   Motivation: If a trade-off has to be made, the most common, standard use-cases should be expressed in the simplest possible way. To cover all cases, corner cases might require more complex language constructs.

4. **Language constructs are required to have an _unambiguous translation to parallel code_ and need to allow translation to efficient code _in the regular use-cases_.**

   Motivation: When translating DSL to executable code, we must not make correctness errors, therefore we cannot allow ambiguous language constructs.
   If we fail,

   - the user will run into hard to debug problems,
   - the toolchain developer cannot reason about the code and will fail in writing correct optimizations.

   On purpose, performance is second and, on purpose, the requirement to produce efficient code is restricted to regular use-cases. Obviously, for a performance portable language, the regular use-cases are required to have an efficient translation. But this principle acknowledges that we cannot exclude that for some special cases an efficient translation cannot be found.

# Parallel Model

The iteration domain is a 3d domain: `I` and `J` axes live on the horizontal spatial plane, and axis `K` represents the vertical spatial dimension. Computations on the horizontal plane are always executed in parallel and thus `I` and `J` are called _parallel_ axes, while computations on `K` are executed sequentially and thus `K` is called a _sequential_ axis.

A `gtscript.stencil` is composed of one or more `computation`. Each `computation` defines an iteration policy (`FORWARD`, `BACKWARD`) and is itself composed of one or more non-overlapping vertical `interval` specifications, each one of them representing a vertical loop over the `K` axis with the iteration policy of the computation. Intervals are specified in their order of execution with each interval containing one or more statements.

The effect of the program is as if statements are executed as follows:

1. _computations_ are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the code,
2. vertical _intervals_ are executed sequentially in the order defined by the _iteration policy_ of the _computation_
3. every vertical _interval_ is executed as a sequential for-loop over the `K`-range following the order defined by the iteration policy,
4. for every _assignment_ inside the _interval_, first, the right hand side is evaluated in a parallel for-loop over the horizontal dimension(s), then, the resulting horizontal slice is assigned to the left hand side.
5. for `if`-`else` statements, the condition is evaluated first, then the `if` and `else` bodies are evaluated with the same rule as above. Some restrictions apply to offset reads, see [Conditionals](#conditionals).

### Examples

In the following, the code snippets are not always complete GTScript snippets, instead parts are omitted (e.g. by `...`) to highlight the important parts. The domain is defined by the intervals `[i,I]`, `[j,J]`, `[k,K]`.

**Rule 4**

```python
with computation(...):
    with interval(...):
        a = b
```

translates to the following pseudo-code snippet:

<table><tr>
<td width="50%", valign="top">

_Parfor_ style: this illustrates how a low-level implementation would look like.

```python
for k:
    tmp_b: IJField
    parfor ij:
        tmp_b = b
    parfor ij:
        a = tmp_b
```

</td>
<td width="50%", valign="top">

_NumPy_ style: this illustrates how users can reason about the code.

```python
for k_ in range(k, K):
    a[i:I, j:J, k_] = b[i:I, j:J, k_]
```

</td>
</tr></table>

which reflects principle 4, the translation to parallel code is unambigous.
Note: Removing the (in this case) unneeded temporary is up to optimization.

In the following examples, the translation of each right hand side to an intermediate temporary is implicit for simplicity and to avoid distraction from the important aspects. NumPy style will be used where the focus of the code snippet is not on the implementation of this rule.

In the following, `k <= K`,

**no specific loop order in k**

```python
with computation(...):
    with interval(k, K):
        a = tmp[1, 1, 0]
        b = 2 * a[0, 0, 0]
```

behaves like

```python
# NumPy semantics
a[i:I, j:J, k:K] = tmp[i+1:I+1, j+1:J+1, k:K]
b[i:I, j:J, k:K] = 2 * a[i:I, j:J, k:K]
```

**forward iteration in k**

```python
with computation(FORWARD):
    with interval(k, K):
        a = tmp[1, 1, 0]
        b = 2 * a[1, 1, 0]
```

behaves like

```python
for k_ in range(k, K):
    a[i:I+1, j:J+1, k_] = tmp[i+1:I+2, j+1:J+2, k_] # extended compute domain
    b[i:I, j:J, k_] = 2 * a[i+1:I+1, j+1:J+1, k_]
```

**backward computation in k with interval specialization**

```python
with computation(BACKWARD):
    with interval(k, -2): # lower interval
        a = tmp[1, 1, 0]
        b = 2 * a[0, 0, 0]
    with interval(-2, K): # upper interval
        a = 1.1
        b = 2.2
```

behaves like

```python
for k_ in reversed(range(K-2, K)): # upper interval
    a[i:I, j:J, k_] = 1.1
    b[i:I, j:J, k_] = 2.2

for k_ in reversed(range(k, K-2)): # lower interval
    a[i:I, j:J, k_] = tmp[i+1:I+1, j+1:J+1, k_]
    b[i:I, j:J, k_] = 2 * a[i:I, j:J, k_]
```

Note that intervals where exchanged to match the loop order.

## Variable declarations

Variable declarations inside a computation are interpreted as temporary field declarations spanning the actual computation domain of the `computation` where they are defined.

### Example

```python
with computation(FORWARD):
    with interval(1, 3):
        tmp = 3
```

behaves like:

```python
tmp = Field(domain_shape)  # Uninitialized field (random data)
for k_ in range(0, 3):
    tmp[i:I, j:J, k_] = 3   # Only this vertical range is properly initialized
```

## Compute Domain

The computation domain of every statement is extended to ensure that any required data to execute all stencil statements on the compute domain is present.

### Example

On an applied example, this means:

```python
with computation(...), interval(...):
    u = 1
    b = u[-2, 0, 0] + u[1, 0, 0] + u[0, -1, 0] + u[0, -2, 0]
```

translates into the following pseudo code:

```python
for k_ in range(k, K):
    u[i-2:J+1, j-2:J, k_] = 1
    b[i:I, j:J, k_] = u[i-2:I-2, j:J, k_] + u[i+1:I+1, j:J, k_] + u[i:I, j-1:J-1, k_] + u[i:I, j-2:J-2, k_]
```

## Conditionals

GTScript supports 2 kinds of conditionals:

- conditionals on scalar expressions
- conditionals on field expressions

### Conditionals on scalar expressions

- Each statement inside the if and else branches is executed according to the same rules as statements outside of branches.
- There is no restriction on the body of the statement.

**Example for scalar conditions**

```python
with computation() with interval(...):
    if my_config_var:
        a = 1
        b = 2
    else:
        a = 2
        b = 1
```

translates to:

```python
for k_ in range(k, K):
    if my_config_var:
        parfor ij:
            a[i, j, k_] = 1
        parfor ij:
            b[i, j, k_] = 2
    else:
        parfor ij:
            a[i, j, k_] = 2
        parfor ij:
            b[i, j, k_] = 1
```

### Conditionals on field expressions

- The condition is evaluated for all gridpoints and stored in a mask.
- Each statement inside the if and else branches is executed according to the same rules as statements outside of branches.
- Inside the if and else blocks the same field cannot be written to **and** read with an offset in the parallel axises (order does not matter).

**Example for conditionals on field expressions**

```python
with computation():
    with interval(...):
        if field:
            a = 1
            b = 2
        else:
            a = 2
            b = 1
```

translates to:

```python
for k_ in range(k, K):
    parfor ij:
        mask[i, j] = (field[i, j, k_] != 0)
    parfor ij:
        if mask[i, j]:
            a[i, j, k_] = 1
    parfor ij:
        if mask[i, j]:
            b[i, j, k_] = 2
    parfor ij:
        if not mask[i, j]:
            a[i, j, k_] = 2
    parfor ij:
        if not mask[i, j]:
            b[i, j, k_] = 1
```

The following cases are illegal:

```python
with computation():
    with interval(...):
        if field:
            b = a[1, 0, 0] # read with offset in 'I' from updated field 'a'
            a = 1
            c = a[0, 1, 0] # read with offset in 'J' from updated field 'a'

with computation():
    with interval(...):
        if field:
            a = 1
        else:
            b = a[1, 0, 0] # read with offset in 'I' from updated field 'a'

with computation(...):
    with interval(...):
        if field:
            a = a[0, 1, 0] # self assignment with offset (i.e. a read with offset and write)
```
