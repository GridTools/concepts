## GTC Transition  
  
Pushing to transition FV3 to new toolchain  
  
**Pros:**  
GridTools v2/memory pool  
DaCe backends  
Plain CUDA backend  
Designing optimizations in the Eve-based IRs should be simpler  
Experience working with Eve  
  
**Cons:**  
Need to finish numpy backend  
Feature work  
  
**Question:**  
If we switch to GTC, should we focus on the GTCUDA backend or plain CUDA backend?  
  
  
## New feature design  
  
Variable vertical offsets  
Horizontal ifs  
Self-assignments  
Numpy backend  
Misc frontend changes (for, while loops)  
  
  
## What are the plans moving forward?  
  
Would like to know what the future is!
